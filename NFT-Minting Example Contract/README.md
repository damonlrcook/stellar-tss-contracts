# Minting Assets txFunction

The goal of this example is to take in three user inputs and then process these inputs to then result in a transaction that will mint the number of assets requested.

1. Amount of the asset to be minted
2. The authorisation key that is needed to approve the minting process
3. A memo, which is a text value to be added to the trnsaction

Overall, this txFunction is extremely basic and does not have the most robust use of security involved through a hard coded authorisation key. However, what this does show is the flexibility that txFunctions have and their ability to provide a third party security/processing service.
