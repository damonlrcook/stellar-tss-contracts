Task-Stellar-TSS
================
Smart contracts designed for the Stellar Turing Signing Servers which are also known as Turrets. 

Intent:
=======
The Task Stellar TSS is designed to provide a range of open source, base txFunctions/contracts to be used on the network of turrets. These functions/contracts are able to conduct many different tasks and provide decentralised approval for transactions. The goal is for these base txFunctions/contracts to provide a starting point for further development and creation, essentially, enabling more users to implement txFunctions/contracts easily.

Provided Contracts
==================
Below is a list of the base txFunctions/contracts that are either being developed.
